# Seattle-Airbnb

### Project Motivation

For the Airbnb dataset we have in the bellow some points that tell us about the dataset:

- Scores of reviews and the describtion
- We have for each reviewer an ID and some comments
- Array of ID plus the price

Now let's see the questions that we are trying to explore and answer:

1. 	
A. Find what are the highest and lowest neighborhood based on the cost?
B. Find what is the variation between the price and the average price?

2. What types of properties are mostly available in Seattle and how does the price vary by property type?

3. What is the most effective feature on the price?
